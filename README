This is the readme file for the Avorion mod "extended xsotan attacks" by Deadonstick.
This mod will add supremely difficult, though rare, additional xsotan encounters when you are close to the galactic core (disttocore <=150).

This mod also increases the firepower of large xsotan ships (small and medium ships are unaffected).

There are two types of extra encounters added by this mod.

The first consists of a huge xsotan fleet of ships with widely varied sizes.
The second is a stupendously large mothership with a huge escort of smaller ships.

Don't install this mod unless you are prepared to die. The rewards however are worth it.
